        Parameters
        ----------
        env: simpy.Environment
            the simulation environment.
        nports: int
            the total number of ports on this switch.

        buffer_size: int
            the size of an outgoing port' bounded buffer, in packets.
        weights: list or dict
            This can be either a list or a dictionary. If it is a list, it uses the flow_id ---
            or class_id, if class-based fair queueing is activated using the `flow_classes' parameter
            below --- as its index to look for the flow (or class)'s corresponding weight (or
            priority for Static Priority scheduling). If it is a dictionary, it contains
            (flow_id or class_id -> weight) pairs for each possible flow_id or class_id.
        flow_classes: function
            This is a function that matches flow_id's to class_ids, used to implement a class-based
            scheduling discipline. The default is an identity lambda function, which is equivalent
            to flow-based scheduling.
        server: str (possible values: 'WFQ', 'DRR', 'SP', or 'VirtualClock')
            The type of the scheduling discipline used for each outgoing port.
        element_id: str
            The (optional) element ID of this component.
